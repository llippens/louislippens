<p style="line-height:.8; font-style:italic; text-align:center"><font size="3">Postdoctoral Researcher in Economics<br></br>Applied Microeconomics - Labour Economics - Experimental Economics<br></br>Hiring Discrimination - Audit Studies</font></p>

### Professional
I am currently active as a postdoctoral researcher in labour economics at Ghent University. My academic work focuses on the determinants and contextual factors contributing to hiring discrimination, an issue that continues to squander individual talent in today's labour market.

My postdoctoral project aims to delve deeper into the relationship between market competition and hiring discrimination, using advanced statistical techniques such as multilevel meta-regression on transnational data to better inform policy interventions.

More broadly, as an affiliated researcher at UGent @ Work, I collaborate on interdisciplinary projects addressing key challenges in the labour market. Our focus is not just academic; we are committed to creating real-world impact by translating our research into evidence-based policy advice.

I hold a master's degree in industrial and organisational psychology from Ghent University and a business degree in management from Vlerick Business School. Prior to re-entering academia and obtaining a joint PhD in economics and sociology, I worked in management consulting, where I gained experience in data governance and data analytics.

My expertise extends from experimental economics, including audit studies, to applied psychometrics and data visualisation.

### Personal
I live with my spouse, Anna, my son, Georges, and our cat, Abel. In a former life, I was a DJ and produced electronic music, and, to date, I still love to get some vinyl playing (from Paul Kalkbrenner and Bonobo to KAYTRANADA and Fred Again..). You might find <a href="https://soundcloud.com/subwaves" target="_blank">some traces</a> of this past scattered around the internet. Another random fact is that I am fond of the sea(side) and used to be a lifeguard on the Belgian coast during the summer months.
